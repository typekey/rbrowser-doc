## RNA Structure
The RNA 2D structure module integrates experimental probing data with computational predictions to provide more accurate and biologically relevant structural models, compared to purely in silico methods.  
Users may also upload their own predicted structures for comparative or integrative analysis.  
A subset of structural predictions is sourced from RNACentral.

## RNA Structure Annotation
The plugin supports structural annotation through the `RNA Annotation Mode`, allowing users to explore key secondary structure elements, including:

- `E`: External loop  
- `S`: Stem  
- `I`: Internal loop  
- `B`: Bulge  
- `M`: Multiloop  
- `H`: Hairpin  
- `X`: Unknown  

## RNA Modification Mode
This mode enables the projection of one-dimensional signal tracks—such as RNA modifications—onto the 2D RNA structure.  
It allows users to visualize the spatial distribution and frequency of modifications like m⁶A or m⁵C in the context of RNA folding.

## RNA Base-Pairing Mode
This mode provides both global and localized views of RNA base pairing, highlighting single-stranded and double-stranded regions to support structure-function analysis.
